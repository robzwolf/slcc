                This causes all Bots' 'makeMoves()' methods to be invoked from the main thread,
                and prevents them from being disqualified if they take longer than the usual time limit.
                This allows you to run in your IDE debugger and pause on break points without timing out.

                Comment this line out if you want to check that your bot is running fast enough.
